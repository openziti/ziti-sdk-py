    Monkeypatch allow to connect to or host  Ziti services when application does not manage its own sockets.

    Most application won't open sockets directly but will use a library or a framework to do the low level

    `openziti.monkeypatch()` make it possible to use Ziti sockets when you don't have access or want to modify
    the code opening sockets or connections.
